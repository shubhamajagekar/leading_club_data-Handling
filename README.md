Introduction 
     A loan is the money you receive from a bank or financial institution in exchange for a commitment to repay the principal amount with interest. Since lenders take the risk of a possible default, they charge a fee to offset this risk – and this fee is known as the interest.
For this study use a data  that is "Predicting who pays back loan." Size of the dataset is 9578 rows & 14 columns.

Objective:
    1.To find the key factor that influence on the loan repayment.
    2. To fit an accurate classification model to the data.
    3.To compare the performance of various classifiers.

Modeling, Evaluation and Results:

Random Forests is a best model from the above explained models.¶
An important point to note is that our model was heavily more balanced towards positive cases. Our target class was not balanced, which would expectedly result in a model's ability to better predict the more highly represented instance of the variable.¶
